# Earnings review – Madrigal (MDGL)

This note is for educational purposes only and is not investment advice.

## Stub
- Conceptual rating / target: Buy / $470 (educational rNPV base).
- Quarter reviewed: Q3 2024.
- Reported date: 31-Oct-2024 (before market open).

## Key takeaways
- Revenue vs consensus: Net revenue $62.2M vs ~$55M Street; product sales entirely Rezdiffra with sequential acceleration from $33M in Q2.
- Rezdiffra launch metrics vs expectations: >80% commercial coverage secured; <5% of covered lives still require biopsy; demand led by hepatology centers with growing community uptake.
- Guidance changes: Raised FY24 net sales outlook to $180–190M (from ~$150M) and reiterated operating expense guidance.
- Management commentary highlight: Focus on reducing diagnostic friction (non-invasive tests) and preparing EU launch package while MAESTRO-NASH Outcomes tracks toward 2026 interim.

## P&L snapshot
- Total revenue: $62.2M (all product revenue; no collaboration revenue).
- Product revenue detail: Rezdiffra scripts growing double digits month-on-month; patient buy-and-bill mix increasing vs specialty pharmacy.
- Operating expenses (R&D, SG&A): R&D $187M (continuing MAESTRO programs + lifecycle combos); SG&A $178M with expected step-up for field force/DTC.
- Cash and runway commentary: ~$1.0B cash/investments provides >12 months runway even at peak launch burn; management comfortable funding MAESTRO Outcomes and EU build.

## Launch and commercial update
- Patient starts / adherence / discontinuations: >8k cumulative starts; persistence trending toward 9–10 months with limited discontinuations (mostly GI events early in therapy).
- Payer coverage progress: National payers plus Medicare Advantage plans onboard; biopsy requirement eased to imaging/ELF in most policies, unlocking PCP referrals.
- Prescriber base evolution: >1,200 prescribers to date with ~35% community hepatologists and growing engagement from endocrinology/obesity clinics.

## Model implications
- rNPV assumptions adjusted: Raise 2024 net to $185M midpoint and lift peak penetration by 100 bps given faster coverage; maintain 28% GTN but monitor rebate creep as volume discounts kick in 2025.
- Scenario mix (bear/base/bull) impact: Base probability maintained at 60% pending outcomes catalysts; bull case weight nudged to 25% (from 20%) given operational de-risking.
- Other thesis-level considerations: Continue to monitor GLP-1 combo data, diagnostic pathway simplification, and manufacturing scale-out before MAESTRO Outcomes readout.
