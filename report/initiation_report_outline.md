# Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (MDGL) – Educational Initiation of Coverage

This document is for educational and portfolio purposes only and does not constitute investment advice or a research recommendation.

## 1. Front stub
- Conceptual rating (Buy/Hold/Sell) for teaching purposes only: **Conceptual Buy / Outperform (educational)**.
- Conceptual target price and implied upside/downside: **$470** per share (~50% upside vs ~$313 close on 22-Nov-2025) driven by $7B peak net sales base case.
- Key stats (ticker, price/date, market cap, net cash, EV, short interest): **MDGL | $313 | ~$18B mkt cap | ~$1.0B net cash (Q3'24) | EV ~$17B | ~9% short interest**.

## 2. Investment summary
- Core thesis bullet 1: Rezdiffra is the first approved therapy for MASH with fibrosis, showing double-digit absolute benefit on both surrogate endpoints and a well-differentiated lipid profile.
- Core thesis bullet 2: Commercial execution progressing — >80% payer coverage with <5% of lives requiring biopsy and rapidly growing specialist demand (Q3'24 Rezdiffra net sales $62M).
- Key upside driver: MAESTRO-NASH Outcomes success could de-risk the entire-class adoption curve and open earlier-stage (F1) label expansion, supporting >$10B peak revenue scenarios.
- Key risk: Long-term outcomes data (event-driven) are still pending; failure or delay would cap penetration and leave MDGL exposed to GLP-1 competition and pricing pressure.
- Additional watch item: Scaling manufacturing and combination strategies with incretin therapies to defend share once Novo/Eli data mature.

## 3. Company overview
### 3.1 Company history
- Timeline placeholders.

### 3.2 Strategy and focus
- Therapeutic focus, clinical priorities, commercial build.

### 3.3 Management and governance
- Key executives, board composition, incentives.

### 3.4 Financial position and cash runway
- Cash/investments ~$1.0B as of Q3'24; quarterly operating cash burn ~$250M as launch investments ramp. Management guiding to sufficient liquidity through MAESTRO outcomes readout.

## 4. Pipeline overview
- Insert pipeline table/figure reference (e.g., from `figures/`).
- Rezdiffra: US launch underway (accelerated approval), EU filing prepared for 1H25.
- MAESTRO-NAFLD-OLE / F4c: two-year data show reductions in non-invasive fibrosis markers and liver volume.
- MAESTRO-NASH Outcomes: fully enrolled (845 pts) measuring decomp/cirrhosis events; interim analysis timing 2026E.

## 5. Resmetirom (Rezdiffra) in MASH
### 5.1 Mechanism of action and biology
- THR-β agonism overview.

### 5.2 MAESTRO clinical program overview
- Trial list summary.

### 5.3 Pivotal MAESTRO NASH results
- Week 52 co-primary endpoints met: NASH resolution without fibrosis worsening (80 mg 25.9%, 100 mg 29.9%, placebo 10.4%); ≥1-stage fibrosis improvement (24–26% vs 14% placebo).
- Consistent benefit across fibrosis strata and diabetic status; MRI-PDFF reductions ~30–40%; LDL-C reduced by ~10–15%.

### 5.4 Outcomes and long-term safety studies
- MAESTRO Outcomes/NAFLD-1 follow-up.

### 5.5 Regulatory status and label
- FDA (Mar 2024) accelerated approval for adults with biopsy-proven MASH F2-F3; no boxed warning; contraindication for decompensated cirrhosis.
- EMA submission planned for 1H25; UK rolling review in progress; label expansion contingent on outcomes data.

## 6. Market opportunity and competitive landscape
### 6.1 Epidemiology and addressable market
- US MASLD prevalence ~25% adults; ~12% progress to F2/F3 (~7.8M). Diagnosed ~15% and specialist-managed ~65% currently (see `analysis/02_market_sizing_scratchpad.py`). Ex-US TAM roughly 2x US with slower access ramp.

### 6.2 Current treatment paradigm
- Standard of care, off-label usage, GLP-1 penetration.

### 6.3 Competitive landscape (including GLP-1 based approaches)
- Key competitors snapshot.

### 6.4 Positioning of Rezdiffra
- First-mover with histologic data; oral daily pill with manageable GI profile. Differentiates vs GLP-1-based regimens (weight-loss focus) by delivering fibrosis regression and cardiovascular-friendly lipid changes.

## 7. Valuation
### 7.1 rNPV framework and key assumptions
- Base case: US peak treated patients 140k, net price ~$34k/year, GTN 28%, PoS 70% until outcomes confirm. Ex-US peak ~90k patients with staged launch (2027+), royalty equivalent 65%.

### 7.2 Scenario analysis (bear/base/bull)
- Table placeholder.

### 7.3 Sensitivity analysis
