# Analysis

This folder holds notebooks and scripts covering clinical, regulatory, epidemiology, pricing, and valuation workstreams for the Madrigal project.

## Suggested file naming
- `01_maestro_trial_readthrough.md` – MAESTRO NASH / NAFLD-1 design and results.
- `02_market_sizing_scratchpad.py` – epidemiology and eligible population calculations.
- `03_pricing_access_notes.md` – pricing, access, and payer notes.
- `04_valuation_checks.ipynb` – sanity checks linking analysis to the model.

Heavy computations or scraping logic should live in `.py` modules, while notebooks stay focused on exploration, documentation, and visualization.
