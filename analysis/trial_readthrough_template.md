## 2. Design
- Study design (randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, etc):
- Population inclusion criteria (e.g. MASH with F2-F3 fibrosis, biopsy requirements):
- Key exclusion criteria:
- Arms and dosing:
- Duration of treatment and follow up:
- Randomization and stratification:
- Statistical powering assumptions (endpoint, effect size, alpha, power):

## 3. Endpoints

- Regulatory rationale:

### Key secondary endpoint(s)
- Definition:
- Time point:
- Regulatory rationale:

### Exploratory endpoint(s)
- Definition:

- Regulatory rationale:

## 4. Results summary
### Efficacy
- Primary endpoint results vs placebo (absolute and relative):
- Key secondary endpoints (fibrosis improvement, NASH resolution, etc):
- Subgroup findings of note:

### Safety and tolerability
- Overall adverse event rates:
- Serious adverse events:
- Discontinuations:
- Specific safety concerns (hepatotoxicity, cardiovascular, etc):

## 5. Regulatory mapping
- Map endpoints/results to FDA/EMA approval criteria:
- Support for accelerated vs full approval vs label expansion:
- Gaps remaining that outcomes trials must address:

## 6. Commercial implications
- Impact on uptake, payer decisions, and positioning vs GLP-1 or other competitors:
- Patient segments where data look strongest/weakest:
- Key questions remaining for prescribers or payers:

## 7. Key risks and uncertainties
- Limitations of trial design (population, endpoints, duration):
- Statistical concerns (multiplicity, missing data):
- Generalizability to real-world patients:
- Unknowns pending outcomes studies:
