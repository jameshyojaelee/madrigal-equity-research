# Trial read-through – MAESTRO-NASH (NCT03900429)

## 1. Trial overview
- Sponsor: Madrigal Pharmaceuticals.
- Indication: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH/NASH) with stage F2-F3 fibrosis.
- Phase: Phase 3, registrational.
- Countries / regions: Multinational (US, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific) across >200 hepatology centers.
- Approximate enrollment: 966 randomized adults across three arms (80 mg, 100 mg, placebo).

## 2. Design
- Study design (randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, etc): Double blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 52-week primary assessment period followed by open-label extensions.
- Population inclusion criteria (e.g. MASH with F2-F3 fibrosis, biopsy requirements): Adults 18–80 with biopsy-confirmed at-risk NASH (NAS ≥4) and fibrosis stage F2 or F3 within 6 months of screening.
- Key exclusion criteria: Cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, other chronic liver etiologies, poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c >9%), prior bariatric surgery within 5 years.
- Arms and dosing: Once-daily oral resmetirom 80 mg, resmetirom 100 mg, or matching placebo on top of diet/exercise counseling.
- Duration of treatment and follow up: 52 weeks blinded therapy for primary endpoints; longer-term follow up for safety and progression to cirrhosis via MAESTRO-NAFLD-OLE and MAESTRO-NASH Outcomes.
- Randomization and stratification: 1:1:1 randomization stratified by fibrosis stage (F2 vs F3), diabetes status, and geographic region.
- Statistical powering assumptions (endpoint, effect size, alpha, power): Designed to detect ≥10 percentage-point difference vs placebo on both co-primary endpoints with 90% power and two-sided alpha 0.025 per endpoint (Hochberg procedure) assuming placebo response 10%.

## 3. Endpoints
### Primary endpoint(s)
- Definition: (1) NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis; (2) ≥1-stage fibrosis improvement with no worsening of NAS.
- Time point: Week 52 liver biopsy (central read).
- Regulatory rationale: Mirrors FDA/EMA surrogate endpoints (MASH resolution and fibrosis improvement) used for accelerated approval decisions.

### Key secondary endpoint(s)
- Definition: ≥2-point NAS reduction, ≥30% relative reduction in liver fat (MRI-PDFF), change in lipids and liver enzymes, PROs.
- Time point: Week 52 for biopsy/MRI endpoints; periodic labs at weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, 52.
- Regulatory rationale: Support magnitude/durability of anti-steatotic, anti-inflammatory effect and cardiometabolic benefit-risk profile.

### Exploratory endpoint(s)
- Definition: Non-invasive fibrosis markers (ELF score, FibroScan stiffness), serum biomarkers (Pro-C3, CK-18), patient-reported outcomes, cardiovascular risk markers.
- Time point: Baseline, week 24, week 52, and follow-on visits.
- Regulatory rationale: Builds bridge to real-world monitoring strategy and endpoint modeling for outcomes trial.

## 4. Results summary
### Efficacy
- Primary endpoint results vs placebo (absolute and relative):
  - NASH resolution w/o fibrosis worsening: 25.9% (80 mg) and 29.9% (100 mg) vs 10.4% placebo (p<0.001).
  - ≥1-stage fibrosis improvement w/o NAS worsening: 24.2% (80 mg) and 25.9% (100 mg) vs 14.2% placebo (p<0.001).
- Key secondary endpoints (fibrosis improvement, NASH resolution, etc): ≥2-point NAS reduction achieved in >45% of treated vs ~25% placebo; MRI-PDFF reduction ~30–40% with active dose; LDL-C lowered ~10–15%, triglycerides down ~10%.
- Subgroup findings of note: Consistent efficacy across fibrosis stages, diabetics vs non-diabetics, and geographic regions; numerically higher responses in F3 and high NAS subgroups.

### Safety and tolerability
- Overall adverse event rates: Similar between groups (~91% any AE); majority mild/moderate.
- Serious adverse events: 10–12% across arms, balanced with placebo; no drug-related deaths.
- Discontinuations: 4–6% active vs 3% placebo, mostly due to GI symptoms.
- Specific safety concerns (hepatotoxicity, cardiovascular, etc): No signal for hepatotoxicity; modest increases in diarrhea/nausea early; favorable lipid profile and no excess cardiovascular events.

## 5. Regulatory mapping
- Map endpoints/results to FDA/EMA approval criteria: Both surrogate endpoints met statistical significance with clinically meaningful effect sizes supporting accelerated approval; ongoing outcomes study needed for full approval.
- Support for accelerated vs full approval vs label expansion: Supports accelerated approval (achieved Mar 2024) and informs potential label expansion into earlier fibrosis once outcomes data mature.
- Gaps remaining that outcomes trials must address: Need to confirm reduction in progression to cirrhosis/decompensation; long-term safety in cirrhotics; combination data with GLP-1s.

## 6. Commercial implications
- Impact on uptake, payer decisions, and positioning vs GLP-1 or other competitors: Demonstrated fibrosis benefit differentiates vs GLP-1s that are primarily metabolic; pharmacoeconomic models rely on avoiding transplant/cirrhosis; payer coverage improving as biopsy requirement drops.
- Patient segments where data look strongest/weakest: Strongest in biopsy-proven F3 with high NAS; limited data in F1/F4 (needs MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 OLE and Outcomes); pediatric or cirrhotic populations not covered yet.
- Key questions remaining for prescribers or payers: Durability beyond 52 weeks, need for maintenance biopsies, strategy for combo with GLP-1/SGLT2, monitoring lipid changes.

## 7. Key risks and uncertainties
- Limitations of trial design (population, endpoints, duration): Biopsy requirement selects motivated centers; 52-week horizon may not capture long-term fibrosis regression or decomp events.
- Statistical concerns (multiplicity, missing data): Co-primary handled via Hochberg; missing biopsies handled via multiple imputation but still ~12% missing.
- Generalizability to real-world patients: Need more data in metabolic syndrome with comorbid CKD/CVD, and in diversified ethnic cohorts.
- Remaining unknowns pending outcomes studies: Hard outcome benefit vs placebo, impact on portal hypertension, long-term safety in compensated cirrhosis.
