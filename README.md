# Madrigal Equity Research Repository

## Executive Summary
- This workspace collects the key artifacts for the Madrigal hit-and-run equity research effort.
- Each top-level directory captures a logical deliverable: initiation report, rNPV modeling, memo notes, datasets, analytical scripts, and supporting figures.
- Keeping this structure makes it easy to hand off findings or iterate on any part of the story without losing context.
