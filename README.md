# Madrigal (MDGL) – Equity Research Project

This repository contains a biotech equity research-style project on Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (MDGL), focused on metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH/MASLD) and Rezdiffra (resmetirom); it exists solely for my own learning and portfolio purposes and should not be treated as investment advice.

## Objectives
- Build a coverage-style initiation report.
- Build a transparent rNPV model (Excel/Sheets).
- Produce 2–3 short ER-style notes.

## Repository structure
- `report/` – report drafts, outlines, and final PDF.
- `model/` – rNPV model files and model-building scripts.
- `notes/` – short ER-style notes (event-driven, earnings, trial read-through).
- `data/` – raw and processed data, download scripts, and metadata.
- `analysis/` – notebooks, analysis scripts, and templates.
- `figures/` – generated figures for report and notes.

## Getting started
- Recommended Python version: 3.10 or newer.
- Create a virtual environment (e.g., `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`).
- Install dependencies once `requirements.txt` is populated: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Disclaimers
- This work is not investment advice.
- No guarantee of accuracy or completeness is provided.
- I hold no position in MDGL; this project is purely educational.
